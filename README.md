# optionable

Work in progress to derive recursive optional structs in rust, e.g. for a rust-analogon
of [Kubernetes apply configurations](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/applyconfigurations).

## Experimental

Nothing here can be even considered an alpha. Everything including the name is subject to change.
Nothing published to crates.io yet.
